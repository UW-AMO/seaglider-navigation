# Contributing

We welcome everyone's contributions.  By participating in this project, you agree to
abide by the Code of Conduct.

## Issues (Bugs and Feature requests)
At a minimum, issues need:
1. Minimal working example of the code that didn't work
1. What happened
1. What you expected to happen


## Pull requests
1. If your change addresses an problem or feature, create an issue to allow
discussion _before_ you write code.  This helps solicit buy-in from 
stakeholders.
1. Create a fork and follow the installation instructions in the README.
1. Make local changes that you want
1. Write some test code.  We don't have CI set up or a comprehensive test module.
However, we still have to check that the changes you're recommending work.
1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with git diff --check before committing.
* Follow [PEP 8][style].
* Write a [good commit message][commit].

## Code of Conduct
Normal open source codes of conduct have injunctions to respect others.  Many 
cite the [contributor covenant][covenant]:

    In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
    contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project
    and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless
    of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
    identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
    status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
    identity and orientation.
